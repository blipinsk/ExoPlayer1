# DEPRECATED

There's been no new development of ExoPlayer 1 for the last 4 years. I don't see a reason why this packaging should still be active.
No new development will be taking place. The library will not be maintained.

Thanks for all the support!!!

## ExoPlayer 1

An external packaging of [Google's ExoPlayer version 1.x.x][1].

Although Google thought about releasing ExoPlayer 2 with a different package name, they seemed to
forgot to change the `artifactId` of the published snapshot. That's why you cannot include both
ExoPlayer 1 and ExoPlayer 2 in your project at the same time (using two simple dependency records).
Which would be really useful if you want to gradually migrate an old ExoPlayer 1 project to the newer version.

This project is a simple repackaging of ExoPlayer 1.x.x versions. It contains no code of my own.
Just a bare minimum to upload a snapshot with a different `groupId` and `artifactId`.

Unfortunately, according to [Issue #1842][2] Google has no plans to introduce the second
`artifactId` for the r2.x.x versions. That's why using a solution like this or including a .jar in
your project are pretty much the only choices you have.

--------

I am keeping the original notation of version numbering. Every version name matches `r1.x.x` pattern.
